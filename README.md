**Empower your AI agents (like Cline/Claude) with secure, efficient, and
token-saving access to your project files.**

This Node.js server implements the
[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://docs.modelcontextprotocol.com/) to
provide a robust set of filesystem tools, operating safely within a defined
project root directory.

---

## ⭐ Why Use This Server?

- **🛡️ Secure & Convenient Project Root Focus:**
  - All operations are **strictly confined to the project root directory**
    (determined by the server's launch context), preventing unauthorized access.
  - Uses **relative paths** from the project root. **Important:** The server
    determines its project root from its own Current Working Directory (`cwd`)
    at launch. The process starting the server (e.g., your MCP host) **must**
    set the `cwd` to your intended project directory.
- **⚡ Optimized & Consolidated Tools:**
  - Most tools support **batch operations** (e.g., reading multiple files,
    deleting multiple items) in a single request.
  - Designed to **reduce AI-server round trips**, minimizing token usage and
    latency compared to executing individual commands for each file operation.
- **🚀 Easy Integration:** Get started quickly using `npx` with minimal
  configuration.
- **🐳 Containerized Option:** Also available as a Docker image for consistent
  deployment environments.
- **🔧 Comprehensive Functionality:** Covers a wide range of common filesystem
  tasks (see Features below).
- **✅ Robust Validation:** Uses Zod schemas to validate all incoming tool
  arguments.

## 🚀 Quick Start: Usage with MCP Host (Recommended: `npx`)

The simplest and recommended way to use this server is via `npx`, configured
directly in your MCP host environment (e.g., Roo/Cline's `mcp_settings.json`).
This ensures you always use the latest version from npm without needing local
installation or Docker.

**Configure your MCP Host:**

Modify your MCP host's settings (e.g., `mcp_settings.json`) to run the server
using `npx`.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@shtse8/filesystem-mcp"
      ],
      "name": "Filesystem (npx)"
    }
  }
}
```

**(Alternative) Using `bunx`:**

If you prefer using Bun, you can use `bunx` instead:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem-mcp": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": [
        "@shtse8/filesystem-mcp"
      ],
      "name": "Filesystem (bunx)"
    }
  }
}
```

**That's it!** Restart your MCP Host environment (if necessary) for the settings
to take effect. Your AI agent can now use the filesystem tools. **Important:**
The server uses its own Current Working Directory (`cwd`) as the project root.
Ensure your MCP Host (e.g., Cline/VSCode) is configured to launch the `npx` or
`bunx` command with the `cwd` set to your active project's root directory.

## ✨ Features

Provides a comprehensive, batch-capable toolset:

- 📁 **Listing & Status:** `list_files`, `stat_items`
- 📄 **Content Manipulation:** `read_content`, `write_content` (incl. append)
- ✏️ **Search & Replace:** `search_files` (regex), `replace_content`
- 🏗️ **Directory Management:** `create_directories`
- 🗑️ **Deletion:** `delete_items` (recursive)
- ↔️ **Moving & Copying:** `move_items`, `copy_items`
- 🔒 **Permissions:** `chmod_items`, `chown_items` (POSIX focused)

## 🐳 Alternative Usage: Docker

For users who prefer containerization or need a specific environment.

**1. Ensure Docker is running.**

**2. Configure your MCP Host:**

Modify your MCP host's settings to run the Docker container. **Crucially, you
must mount your project directory to `/app` inside the container.**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem-mcp": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-v",
        "/path/to/your/project:/app",
        "shtse8/filesystem-mcp:latest"
      ],
      "name": "Filesystem (Docker)"
    }
  }
}
```

**Explanation:**

- `-v "/path/to/your/project:/app"`: Mounts your local project directory into
  the container at `/app`. The server inside the container will treat `/app` as
  its root. **Remember to use the correct absolute path for your system.**
- `shtse8/filesystem-mcp:latest`: Specifies the Docker image. Docker will pull
  it if needed.

**3. Restart your MCP Host environment.**

## 🛠️ Other Usage Options

### Local Build (For Development)

1. Clone: `git clone https://github.com/shtse8/filesystem-mcp.git`
2. Install: `cd filesystem-mcp && npm install`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Configure MCP Host:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem-mcp": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/path/to/cloned/repo/filesystem-mcp/build/index.js"],
      "name": "Filesystem (Local Build)"
    }
    
    **Note:** When running a local build directly with `node`, ensure you launch the command from the directory you intend to be the project root, as the server will use `process.cwd()` to determine its operational scope.
  }
}
```

## 💻 Development

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Build: `npm run build` (compiles TypeScript to `build/`)
4. Watch for changes: `npm run watch` (optional, recompiles on save)
